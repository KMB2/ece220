# ECE 220 SPRING 2019 COURSEWORK
## ABOUT
Advanced use of LC-3 assembly language for I/O and function calling convention. C programming, covering basic programming concepts, functions, arrays, pointers, I/O, recursion, simple data structures, linked lists, dynamic memory management, and basic algorithms. Information hiding and object-oriented design as commonly implemented in modern software and computer systems programming.

## TOPICS COVERED
- Assembly language programming with subroutines and stacks
- Basic programming concepts in C  
- Functions  
- Arrays  
- Pointers  
- I/O  
- Recursion  
- Simple data structures such as linked lists and trees  
- Basic sorting algorithms  
- Concepts in object-oriented programming  

## COURSE GOALS
This course focuses on C programming, where each new C concept is introduced based on the fundamental concepts described in ECE120. We cover basic programming concepts, functions, arrays, pointers, I/O, recursion, simple data structures, and concepts in object-oriented programming. A bottom-up understanding of computing systems has proven more successful in helping students to understand advanced concepts in computing that follow in the ECE curriculum.
